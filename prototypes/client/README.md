# Bundle preloading client â€” prototype

This prototype uses a service worker to issue requests for Web Bundles, process the received content, and store the resources in a cache. It relies on [the `wbn` Node.js module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wbn/) to manipulate [the Web Bundle format](https://github.com/wpack-wg/bundled-responses).

## Build

* run `npm install`
* run `npm run-script build` to prepare the service worker script
* build [the server](../server) as well

## Try out

To try out a small demo, simply launch a server pointing to this folder:

```
cd ../server/
node server.js http://localhost 8080 ../client img
```

The demo page will preload images 1 to 5 using a Web Bundle. Take a look at your browser's network inspector to see what happens as you use the buttons to add each of the images: the first five images will be loaded immediately, as they are already cached, but the last five will need to be fetched one by one on the spot.

## Experiment

If you want to test the prototype on a different page:

* build this project
* copy the files `bundlepreload.js` and `service-worker-browserified.js` to the root folder of the new page
* add `<script src='bundlepreload.js'></script>` to the new page
* add one or more `<script type="bundlepreload">` tags listing the resources to bundle in JSON format, for example:

```html
<script type="bundlepreload">
  {
    "source": "https://example.com/assets.wbn",
    "resources": [
        "https://example.com/assets/styles.css",
        "https://example.com/assets/header.png",
        "https://example.com/assets/icon.bmp",
        "https://example.com/assets/animations.js"
    ]
  }
</script>
```

Relative URLs are supported, so the above could become:

```
<script type="bundlepreload">
  {
    "source": "./assets.wbn",
    "resources": [
        "assets/styles.css",
        "assets/header.png",
        "assets/icon.bmp",
        "assets/animations.js"
    ]
  }
</script>
```

## Debug

By default, building this project will create a minified version of the service worker source file.

When debugging, use `npm run-script debug` to create a version of `service-worker-browserified.js` that has source maps and is not minified. Bear in mind that this file will be several times larger than the default version.
